      Ambitious and passionate about becoming a solid Product Manager. I have over
      3 years of hands-on experience in SaaS product development. With a software
      engineering background and a delicate business mind, I leverage technology
      to serve businesses. So far, I have managed multiple projects from different
      business domains, most of the products were built from scratch and rolled
      out successfully. I enjoyed the fast-paced environment, fostering product
      innovation. Especially empowered to drive products grow business and make
      society better. Outside of work, I read news, travel abroad, learn about the
      culture and history of other countries which helps me find life balance and
      refill the energy for a new day.
